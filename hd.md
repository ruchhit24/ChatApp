 the history object is provided by the React Router library. It allows components to interact with the browsing history, such as programmatically navigating to different pages within the application.

In the context of the VerifyEmail component, the history object is used to redirect the user to the home page ("/") upon successful verification of the OTP. After verifying the email, the user should be redirected to the home page to continue using the application.

Here's how it works:

When the user enters the correct OTP and clicks the "Verify" button, the handleVerify function is called.

Inside handleVerify, if the OTP verification is successful (i.e., the backend responds with success), history.push("/") is used to redirect the user to the home page ("/").

If there's an error during OTP verification or the OTP is incorrect, the user remains on the VerifyEmail page, and an error message is displayed.

By using history.push("/"), the component is able to programmatically navigate the user to a different page within the application, facilitating a seamless user experience.
